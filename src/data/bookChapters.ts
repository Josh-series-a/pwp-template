    title: "CHAPTER 1: HAVE A PLAN",
    theme: "Planning",
    content: `I spend a lot of time talking with small business owners about the stresses and strains of running their businesses. They will talk about lack of money, staff not doing what they should do,  rising costs, awkward suppliers and a whole raft of operational issues that stress a business owner.

However, more often than not, as I talk with the business owners, it becomes glaringly apparent that they do not have a plan for where the business is going. They don't have a sense of direction. This causes the owner a huge number of problems and consequently significantly increases their stress levels.

Why Do You Need a Plan?

Having a plan for your business is essential for several compelling reasons.

1. It will significantly reduce your stress levels by providing a clear sense of purpose and direction, alleviating that sense of the business being a constant grind that can be so exhausting.

2. A well-structured plan will empower you to distinguish good opportunities from bad ones, enabling you to make informed decisions about which projects will genuinely help you achieve your goals. This sense of empowerment will boost your confidence and capability as a business owner.

3. It will resolve the dilemma of how you allocate your limited time and money. You can do this much more effectively when you have a clear vision of where you want your business to go.

4. A plan ensures that your team has guidance in their day-to-day decisions, helping them prioritise tasks, concentrate on the right customers, and make choices that support the business's objectives.

5. A well-articulated plan is crucial for securing financial backing from investors or banks. It will demonstrate how the company will use the investment, what it will achieve as a result, and how it will repay the investment. This can be a key factor in convincing potential investors or lenders of the viability of your business.

That's where this book will start; I will help you create a plan. Your plan will give you a sense of direction and a business model for getting there. In creating a plan, you will also ask, "What do you want to do when you reach your preferred destination? Will you want to sell the business or pass it on to family members? What do you want your legacy to be?"

Throughout Prosper With Purpose, you will see references to environmental and social considerations. These are increasingly impinging on business decisions whether or not the owner cares about them. It's becoming clearer by the day that both customers and staff are increasingly concerned about these issues, and companies need to build these concerns into their planning.

The subsequent sections on People and Profits will discuss how to develop the two most essential resources required to implement any successful plan.

There are libraries worth of books published on how to plan. However, for a small business owner, it's relatively simple. There are three key ingredients. First, you need to know where you want to go and what you want to achieve with your business. Second, you need a business model for how you're going to do that. Finally, you will decide what actions you will take to implement the model so you get to where you want to go.

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
When you picked up Prosper With Purpose, did you think, "This sounds good: I want to grow so that I can pay myself"? If you did, my alarm bells are ringing.

It's a very common answer; I meet it a lot. You feel you're not earning any money now because you haven't grown the business enough. That may well be true, but before you go any further, I want you to stop reading here, and I want you to go directly to Chapter 16.

Let's ensure you've got the business model right financially before considering growing. If you don't, you'll find yourself working even harder and longer and still have nothing to show for it.

Do you need to grow so you can pay yourself? Go to Chapter 16 Making Money and Getting Paid now.`,

    content: `The most important thing in business is knowing where you want to go and how you'll get there. You wouldn't get in a car without knowing where you wanted to go. Most people wouldn't take a job without an idea of what prospects it offers.

So why not have a destination for your business? Where would you like it to take you?

When you close your eyes, what does your future look like? How do you imagine you and your business being in three to five years? What does the destination look like? Can you describe the business and how your life would be different?

Some key questions to ask yourself:
What should be the benefits of running your business?
Where would you like to be spending your time?
What would you like to be doing with your family?
What would you like to be doing with your leisure time?
How much time do you envisage spending at work?
What do you want to be doing when you are at work?
Do you want to be famous?
Do you want to be wealthy?
Do you want recognition from your business sector?

In a nutshell, the above questions will answer the ultimate question: what do you want?

In terms of your business, ask yourself the following questions:
What do you want your business to look like?
Do you want it to be highly regarded in the locality?
Do you want it to earn plaudits internationally?
Do you want it to win prizes?
Do you want it to be regarded as the best in the sector?
What do you want it to be?

The bottom line is, what is your dream?

These are crucial questions to ask yourself when running a business. What is it that you want the business to do, and in particular do for you?

Without a Mission, You Waste Energy
I firmly believe you need to start how you intend to carry on. You need to start your journey in business in line with where you want to end up.

Having that clear line of sight enables you to really focus your energy. It will allow you to concentrate your limited resources of time and money on the ultimate goal and not waste them on diversionary activities.

I illustrate this in the following case study.

üîé Case Study
I once worked with a lady I'll call Beatrice, who wanted to set up a travel agency for Francophone West Africa. Beatrice was from that area, spoke French and English well, and had many necessary contacts.

However, she thought she needed more money to start the business. She wanted my advice about setting up a sandwich-making business to earn this money, which she could then use to set up the travel agency.

I asked her, "Do you have any experience in catering?" She replied, "Absolutely none" I continued, "Do you think you'd like making sandwiches?" She said, "I can't imagine anything worse. It's boring and tedious." I questioned, "Why on earth would you want to do that? "I think it's a way of making some money, and that will enable me to start my travel agency," she explained.

I then told Beatrice, "I think you will waste a lot of energy going in the wrong direction. You should set off from day one to be a travel agent for the West African diaspora."

We then talked about the strategy of starting up a small travel agent business, gradually getting some early sales, selling itineraries and moving through the gears in a way that aligned with her ultimate ambition to be a travel agent. Beatrice dropped the sandwich-making idea completely and instead focussed her energies on organising travel to West Africa.

What's the Big Deal with Mission?
Why have I started this book with such a big emphasis on knowing where you want to go? The following case study demonstrates the power of a business mission.

üîé Case Study
When I began Green-Works, I  met a fabulous man called Peter Lehman, a recently retired commercial director for Centrica who was a very generous but astute businessman. I cheekily asked him if he would help me develop Green-Works, a tiny company with about ¬£20,000 turnover.

At the time, I was about to go into hospital for a knee operation, so I was wholly dependent on a part-time, 24-year-old history graduate driving a rented vehicle. He looked at me and said, "Tell me. What do you want to achieve in Green-Works? What's the mission?" I replied quite simply. "I want to make a significant, measurable difference to the amount of office furniture that goes to landfill, and I want to create a new culture of reuse and recycling around it."

Peter was impressed and agreed to join the board as chairman, saying, "That's a powerful ambition, and I like it, but only for a year." He warned, "We need to see how it goes."

Within a few weeks, I was invited to a meeting with HSBC. I still, to this day, have no idea how they'd even heard of Green-Works. We were a tiny company with no marketing budget. I went along with my graduate employee, Chris Triggs. I'd had my operation by then, so I was on crutches with a full leg plaster. As I often say to people, the entirety of Green-Works went to see HSBC, all three working legs!

We were taken up into the boardroom of the old Midland Bank, a very august, beautiful oak-panelled room with wonderful mahogany furniture. We met the Senior Procurement Manager, who had travelled down from Sheffield, and the CSR manager.

The two talked about the imminent completion of their new headquarters at Canary Wharf. They explained how they would like me to help them with the furniture made redundant as staff moved out of their old offices. I remember how I naively asked them if they were letting out most of that huge building, and they said, "No, no, that's our new headquarters. We intend to move everything out of the City of London into that new tower in Canary Wharf."

At that point, the penny dropped. These men wanted Green-Works, this tiny organisation with one part-time employee, a rented van and no office, to take on what would end up being the largest commercial office clearance in Europe and possibly the history of the world.

How would I respond? At this point, the mission statement I'd outlined to Peter Lehman all those weeks before came into play. The words echoed through my mind as I formulated my answer. When would I ever get such a golden opportunity to deliver on the mission I'd set out then? If I wasn't going to do it now, when would I ever do it?

Of course, it was ludicrous. We completely lacked the financial, physical and logistical capacity, experience or knowledge to take on such a task. We could not dispose of the furniture. We had no marketing. We had no market. We couldn't conceivably do it. Up to this point, we'd handled probably 170 desks in total. This contract would require us to handle 7000!

Frankly, it wasn't and shouldn't have been conceivable. However, there it was. These two experienced senior managers in HSBC asked if I would take it on. I said, "Yes, I would, but I'd need some financing upfront. As you can see, we're a tiny organisation, but we have the will, and if you help us with the finances, we'll do it."

That set-in train the extraordinary set of events described in this book. It enabled Green-Works to get on the map, and it all started with a very clear mission statement.

Great Mission Statement Examples
Divine Chocolate: "We exist to help end exploitation in the cocoa industry. We champion the needs of farmers, enabling them to thrive and prosper and together build a sustainable and fair world."
Google: "To organise the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful."
C√¢r-y-M√¥r: "C√¢r-y-M√¥r is committed to starting the first commercial seaweed and shellfish farm in Wales to motivate and inspire others to duplicate. This zero-input farming uses no fertiliser, pesticides or freshwater. Our goal is to improve the coastal environment and the well-being of the local community. We aim to stimulate jobs and give people a route into the Welsh seafood sector, an industry of growing national importance."
Change Please: "We want a world where homelessness is reduced through trade, its stigma is eliminated, and people experiencing homelessness remain valued members of society."
Tesla: "Accelerating the World's Transition to Sustainable Energy"

In all these examples it's clear that the objectives the company has are not simply financial or economic. The owners and leaders of these organisations want to achieve something bigger, and they are using business to enable them to achieve that. Whether it's in the commercial or not-for-profit sector, having a clear mission statement or a mountain to climb will help focus your energies.

What's Your Mission?
In the following section, you will work out what your mission statement could be. As Figure 1 shows, there are many reasons why people run businesses.

Figure 1: What's Your Mission?
I appreciate that you may regard the idea of having a mission statement as marketing fluff. In many cases, that's exactly what it is. However, if used properly, a mission statement can and should give you and the organisation a real sense of direction.

It also helps you make choices. For instance, Tesla would not engage in any activities relating to carbon-emitting energies or, any activities that slow down the transition to sustainable energy. At Change Please, the mission statement is to reduce homelessness through trade. That's a very clear statement of intent. It isn't trying to raise charitable funds to provide housing. It's specifically there to enable individual homeless people to improve their well-being and their material wealth through trade. New opportunities to trade would fit the mission, but charity fundraising would not.

Having a mission statement has given me a clearer sense of direction. The clarity that a well-drafted mission statement can give will make many of your business decisions much easier. It can also provide a clearer narrative to potential employees when recruiting. Additionally, it can help you make a compelling case when raising money from investors and funding organisations.

How Do You Create a Mission Statement?
Whether you're just starting your business or it's relatively mature and employing staff, getting others involved in drafting a mission statement is a good idea.

This draws out the combined experience of everyone around you and helps you clarify what's truly important. For employees, it engages them all and attracts them to an agreed mission. It also helps to better understand what motivates them to come to work.

In essence, to successfully make the climb, you need to map a journey that answers three fundamental questions, as shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2: Create Your Mission Statement

Exercise 2: Create a Mission Statement
Work with others on your team to answer the three questions in this table. It's extremely useful to enable a team discussion on each of these points. Psychologically, it's vital that every team member has an opportunity to contribute to the mission statement.

It's also beneficial to hear the differing perspectives to better understand how individual team members relate to the company and what is important to them.

Defining these three aspects can be difficult, and it may take a few attempts to hone them, but I promise, it's worth the effort.`,

    title: "CHAPTER 3: TIMELINE",
    theme: "Planning",
    content: `I found that the best way to answer the question "How do I get somewhere?" is to imagine being there in the first place and working backwards.

It's not an easy process to do. It requires you to use all your imagination to project a desired future and simultaneously push aside the realities of your current situation.

Most people start from where they currently are and obsess about the next one or two steps forward, in other words, the things that are causing them immediate challenges. In approaching the problem that way, I've found that it stunts people's ambition. The immediate issues make ambitious, longer-term objectives feel impractical and implausible.

Future-Back Thinking

By starting where you want to end up and imagining yourself in that position, you suddenly free yourself of the resource constraints that you are currently experiencing. By imagining you're already there, you create a scenario where you have the necessary resources, staff and facilities. It's much easier to look back from there and ask, "How did I get here?"

As you work backwards to your current position, you can see more readily what would have to change to get you to the place you're looking back from. Hopefully, this example from my experience will help you visualise this.

üîéCase Study
My ambition for Green-Works was to make a significant difference in the amount of office furniture sent to landfill. It was clear that the finance sector and related services were disposing of the majority of office furniture. Therefore, to make that significant difference, I would have to have a capability in all the places where the finance industry was based.

Although the finance sector is predominantly based in London, we realised that back offices and support facilities were located in several cities across England and Scotland, particularly around Birmingham, Leeds, Edinburgh and Bristol.

Our clients were national organisations, and they had offices across the entire country. If Green-Works was to succeed and secure contracts with these large organisations (and, in turn, deliver on our mission), we would have to be able to offer a service nationally.

The challenge then was to work out how we could go national. We were a tiny organisation with no capital funding. We were a not-for-profit company, i.e., one limited by guarantee with no shares. This meant that we were unable to attract investment. How could we expand our warehouse footprint across the nation?

Having worked out where we wanted to be, we needed to work out how to get there. The most obvious answer was to franchise. Working backwards, the next question was how and who to franchise with.

The 'who' was relatively easy. Several socially-minded organisations across the country recycle domestic furniture for poverty relief in the community. We thought talking to them about increasing their capacity and recycling office furniture would be relatively straightforward.

Thinking back from the 'who,' we had to determine what they would need from us. One element would be a fully written down operational system. This had to be accompanied by a training manual to instruct the franchisee's staff team.

To create a franchise operations manual, we needed to develop our own internal manual. We would also have to consider how we would work with the franchisees regarding communication and support.

We also realised that we would have to increase our national sales capacity and develop our partnerships with national logistic organisations that could support us.

Using the 'future-back' model, we could track back from a future position of a national network of warehouses to what we would need to focus on in the next 6‚Äì12 months to convert our dream into reality.

The fully equipped mountaineer, shown in Figure 3, can describe in detail the equipment she needed, as well as the physical and mental training she had to undertake to climb the mountain.

It's much more intimidating and challenging to imagine what's required to climb a mountain if your perspective is that of the day-tripper hiking through the hills.

Exercise 3: Use Future-Back Planning
Please use the scale on the following page to work back from your desired goal. Firstly, visualise yourself achieving the goal at the end of the scale.

Now, think about where you would be one year before that moment.

What resources did you have? What did your organisation look like? What size and type of customers did you have?

In short, what do you think you need at that point to take the final step towards your goal? Visualise what that point would have looked like and think through the situation a year before, which made this place possible.

Repeat the process above to go back up to 6 years until you hit the present time.

    title: "CHAPTER 4: EXIT STRATEGY",
    theme: "Planning",
    content: `As I look back on my early business career, one of the biggest mistakes I made was not having an idea about what would happen when my business ended.

I just imagined that I would be the boss, and it would just keep going. When you stop to think, that isn't very realistic. If you're lucky, you will get old and want to retire. However, many things could happen that make you unable or unwilling to run your business long before then.

An exit strategy is not just a plan for things going wrong or when you get too old. It's a positive concept which can give you a powerful sense of direction.

As we've seen in the previous chapter, a sense of direction helps dictate your strategy and how you allocate resources and manage the business in ways that help you achieve your aims.

There are several potential exit strategies.

Retire and Close
This is probably the most sensible option for very small companies entirely dependent on the founder.  However, for even a slightly larger company where other people share responsibility for running the business, it feels wasteful not to look to preserve it beyond your working life. Do you really want the organisation you have put so much effort into to stop existing when you retire? If you become infirm, do you want all that hard work to disappear?  Without a strategy and a plan for succession, that is, sadly, the most likely scenario.

Sell
One of my clients, Umesh, had a crystal clear vision of a trade sale for his business. He envisaged an exit strategy before he even began his business, as the following story explains.

üîéCase Study
"From the very start of conceiving my business, I was keen to have a concrete vision for the end goal.  I'd seen (and worked for) far too many businesses stumble along, promising their employees 'jam tomorrow' that never ultimately crystallises.

In my case, I knew that we would be targeting an exit (of some description) within seven years.  Having a valuation in mind was helpful, as was thinking through what the likely exit route was.  The former helps to work backwards to design yearly plans (revenue, headcount, expenditure, etc.), and the latter helps refine the business model.

In my case, we knew we were likely targeting a trade sale ‚Äî mainly because it's a tough niche for large incumbents to crack, so they are pretty acquisitive when an interesting proposition comes along.

Having that 'end goal' in mind is also a seriously powerful tool for attracting, retaining and motivating staff. When they know where the goalposts are, i.e., why the business is doing what it's doing, where the incentives lie for them, why we move at the pace we do and demand what we do from them, they can buy into the vision and give 100%.

The other benefit is that it encourages you, as a founder, to operate at a 'best practice' level. Those bad habits that small business owners often pick up just won't fly if you're targeting a sale to private equity or a complex acquirer, especially if your end goal is to take the business public."

Employee Buyout
Many owners decide to sell their business to their senior management teams instead of an outside buyer. In this way, they hope to keep the people who know the business and motivate them to work even harder.  However, this can be a challenging and arduous process to complete. Check out the Resources section at the end of this chapter for a revealing article on employee buyout.

Pass On to Family
Another popular exit strategy is to pass the business on within the family, as seen in the following case study.

üîéCase Study
Bernie Suresparan drives his business, We Care Group, along three core values: family, honesty and respect. It's no surprise, therefore, to hear that he fully intends to pass on the business to his two children.

In his mid-60s, with no sign of wanting to retire anytime soon, Bernie is preparing for his children to take over. They are already involved in the company's running and are rapidly gaining experience in how it works.

The business is complex, and it's difficult to predict when his children will be ready to take over the reins, so he has made provision for bringing in a more experienced chief executive as an interim step towards their taking over.

This is a good example of solid succession planning for a business, which Bernie clearly sees as a positive legacy and a valuable contribution to North West England.

Bernie explains, "Our people make our business successful, and we are proud to have the best people in our company. We can only achieve continued success by good succession planning, which is what I am concentrating on. We believe in making this company an employer of choice in the next few years."

Make Redundant
For some organisations, especially in the social sector, there is a final type of exit strategy. The following case study from founder and trustee Georgie Fienberg explains how AfriKids and their True Empowerment model is an excellent example.

"AfriKids is a British charitable organisation set up 'to ensure that every child in Ghana is afforded his or her rights as outlined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and to do this by building the capacity and resources of local people, organisations and initiatives in such a way that they will be able to continue their efforts independently and sustainably in the future.

Initially, most funding decisions were made by an office in London. However, over 25 years, the organisation has reversed that. Today, almost all decisions are made in AfriKids Ghana, where a dedicated team of over 100 staff drives the organisation's mission forward compared to the London offices' seven.

This local team has developed self-sustaining projects and grown its partnerships and fundraising capacity, a true testament to the power of local empowerment and the success of AfriKids' model.

AfriKids is now redefining its mission. It feels that it can replicate the model of local empowerment and take it to other communities across Africa.

Our intentional planning to shift the power to AfriKids Ghana has been pivotal in sharpening our focus and effectiveness. By empowering our Ghanaian team to lead and make critical decisions, we've not only ensured that our initiatives are deeply rooted in local context and needs but also fostered a sense of ownership and sustainability that drives our mission forward with unparalleled dedication and clarity."

Figure 4: What's Next?

Exercise 4: Define Your Exit Strategy
Imagine reaching your business goal, or at the very least, you've gone as far as you can towards it. As you look around and survey the future, what would you like to do with your life beyond that goal? What would you like to happen to your business?

With that future in mind, I invite you now to take the Exit Strategy Challenge.

If you can answer each of these questions in detail, you're on your way to a genuine plan for exiting your business and realising that future.

Remember, a strategy without a plan and resources is only a dream.

    title: "CHAPTER 5: FUTURE-FIT PLANNING FOR SUSTAINABILITY",
    theme: "Planning",
    content: `I strongly recommend including environmental and social considerations in your business planning from the very beginning of your entrepreneurial journey. You might find yourself wondering, "Why? What impact can a small company truly make?" Firstly, I've seen first-hand how even small companies can influence major companies with fresh ideas. Secondly, small companies are often much closer to their communities and can offer direct support in ways larger organisations cannot. And lastly, as your company grows, so will the impact and reach of your ideas.

Let's start with the undeniable truth: social and environmental challenges are shared global issues. Whether it's climate change, resource depletion or social inequality, these problems affect us all. We all have a role to play in addressing them. Yes, your individual contribution might seem modest in the grand scheme, but collectively, the actions of small businesses add up to powerful change.

However, let's go beyond altruism. As Figure 5 illustrates, businesses are being pushed and cajoled to do more on these issues. There are six compelling reasons why taking environmental and social performance seriously should be a core part of your business strategy:

1. Business holds the key.
2. The cost of inaction is rising.
3. Regulations are coming in thick and fast.
4. Customers want and expect it.
5. Staff want it!
6. The competition is doing it.

These reasons aren't just about doing good ‚Äî they're about ensuring the long-term resilience of your business, deepening engagement with your customers and employees, and positioning your company for growth in an evolving market.

As you navigate the entrepreneurial landscape, you'll discover that businesses embracing sustainability and social responsibility are more adaptable to disruptions, more attractive to talent, and more trusted by customers. In a world where environmental crises and social demands are reshaping how we live and work, the businesses that succeed will be those that take proactive, thoughtful steps to address these challenges.

The following chapter explores how planning for environmental and social issues can enhance your business's resilience, secure continuity and foster meaningful connections with the people who matter most ‚Äî your staff and your customers.

Business Holds the Key

Businesses hold the key to a cleaner, healthier and Net Zero world. They play a critical role because they are both the cause and solution to many of the world's significant challenges. Small businesses, in particular, are the driving force behind innovations that can improve lives and be kinder to the environment. They have the competitive incentive to reduce input and operating costs while creating products that are easier and cheaper for their customers to use. The products and services they produce are responsible for nearly one-fifth of the UK's carbon emissions. In short, every business needs to get involved.

This is undoubtedly the view of the UK Government. In May 2021, it launched the Together For Our Planet Business Climate Leaders Campaign.

In its press release at the launch, the SME Climate Hub said, "The United Kingdom alone has six million SMES, which generate ¬£2.2 trillion of revenue to the economy, making them essential on the road to net-zero, and a community that cannot be left behind as we transition to the green economy‚Ä¶ the UK Government is calling on companies of all sizes to join the SME Climate Hub and the Race to Zero and establish plans to meet their commitments‚Ä¶ [and] to encourage small businesses to halve their emissions by 2030 in line with the Paris Agreement and cut their emissions to net zero by 2050 or sooner."

Businesses play a pivotal role in shaping the environment due to their considerable influence on resource consumption, emissions and innovations. They are among the largest consumers of natural resources and primary producers of waste and emissions. Due to their scale, even small shifts in business practices can have a broad environmental impact.

When businesses choose sustainability, they set a path for others to follow, making environmental progress both scalable and impactful.

The Cost of Inaction Is Rising

Aside from pleasing your staff, there's a real cost to not doing anything on the environmental front. For example, look at the cost of waste disposal and the tax imposed on waste you send to landfill. This has gone up exponentially since it was introduced in 1990. At that time, it was ¬£7 per tonne. If the annual rate of increase had stuck with inflation, it would now be something like ¬£14 per tonne. As of April 2024, it is ¬£103.70 per tonne!

The government has accelerated the rate of increase, partly to earn some revenue but mainly to deter organisations from putting their waste into landfill.

Regulations Are Coming Thick and Fast

Everywhere you look as business owners, you can see new regulations popping up. It could be new parking restrictions or regulations about what vehicles can be driven into parts of the city. It could be the Biodiversity Net Gain regulations for developers or the bans and restrictions of single-use plastics.

These regulations are coming in thick and fast. To stay in business, let alone thrive, you need to comply with all these regulations. You need to get on the front foot and meet them head-on.

There is an excellent book on this subject especially for micro and small businesses.
It really is ‚Ä¶just good business by Jill Poet offers a pragmatic, common-sense approach to operating a business more sustainably. It will help you identify the main areas where you can have the biggest impact and focus your attention on what really matters.

Figure 5: Change Is Imminent

Customers Want and Expect It

This is probably the biggest driver for most small businesses to adopt new environmental or social practices. If you're dealing with large corporate organisations or public bodies, you will already see questions from them about your environmental performance.

This is set to increase dramatically. The NHS, for example, has a 'Net Zero by 2040' plan, which requires contractors and subcontractors to meet the same standard. Very soon, no organisation will be able to contract with the NHS unless it can demonstrate that it's on the path to 'Net Zero by 2040.'

The same applies to contractors and subcontractors to corporate organisations such as Unilever. They're setting their own standards and targets and expect their suppliers to match them. Otherwise, they will not be allowed to supply them.

This pressure from large corporate bodies and public sector organisations will force almost all enterprises to adopt more stringent, effective, pro-environment, pro-social policies and put them into practice. It will become an expectation of business, if it's not already, as the following case study demonstrates.

üîéCase Study
One of our corporate partners at Green-Works was a company called Interface. They are a massive, multinational, $1bn+ turnover company that manufactures carpet tiles. They are extremely progressive in their environmental ambitions and were significantly ahead of the curve in terms of aspiration to become net zero and fully sustainable.

In 1994, Interface founder Ray Anderson described the experience of reading Paul Hawken's The Ecology of Commerce as an epiphany, his "spear in the chest" moment that changed his perspective on business and sustainability.

We were a natural fit as Green-Works could reuse redundant tiles, and they could advertise our service of providing high-quality reused tiles to local charities. They could take the credit, and we could get the work.

However, talking to their salespeople made me realise the other and potentially more significant benefit of our relationship.

As I was briefing the sales team on what we did, they became very enthusiastic. One of them told me that our service was a tremendous asset to them. Initially, I thought it was because we disposed of redundant carpet tiles, but the sales executive explained that our service was beneficial to them for a completely different reason. Their focus on sustainability and environmental impact was a key differentiator from their competition. Using our service reinforced that message with their customers.

According to these sales executives, their customers loved carpet tiles. Technically, they were high-quality, great-value tiles ‚Äî but so were their competitors'. What made Interface different from the rest of the market was its environmental and social commitment. The fact that it had a plan for its redundant carpet tiles set it apart from its competition.

Having us as a solution to the waste problem and being able to discuss that openly with their potential customers was a significant advantage. It gave them a competitive edge.

In essence, the executives were explaining to me that Interface had used environmental sustainability as a tool to motivate their employees and drive their market capture. This wasn't an exercise in corporate social responsibility; it was a hardheaded business strategy.`,

    content: `Ideally, you should complete your Future-Fit Business Model Canvas on an entirely blank sheet of paper. You shouldn't take into consideration any of the realities on the ground. You are trying to get an in-principle idea of how your business should run and what it needs to do to reach its customers and to achieve its goals.

Having developed the ideal Future-Fit Business Model Canvas, you must now check in on reality. You need to work out how well you deliver on the business model you've described. This is where the SWOT analysis comes in.

The SWOT analysis is one of the best-known tools for starting a planning process. It comprises a two-by-two grid that asks for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. Everyone can engage with it and share their perspective on the current situation.

Doing a SWOT analysis in conjunction with the Future-Fit Business Model Canvas will prove remarkably effective at pointing out areas of weakness and gaps in your understanding. It should also draw out the things that you do well and the things that your customers love.

How to Do a SWOT Analysis
Overview
It's best to do a SWOT analysis with your team; by team, I mean most of your staff. Bring in junior, inexperienced people and people working in different parts of the organisation. They will know areas of your business that you have no idea about.

Firstly, ask your team to look at the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats facing the business as it currently sees and understands them. This will help you to identify the key things that you need to do more of, things that you need to stop doing and the things that you need to get better at.

However, the vital thing is to decide what you will do about that situation. My enhanced version of the SWOT analysis (see Exercise 11 at the end of this chapter) has four extra squares, one attached to each word. The extra boxes give you the nudge to think through how you would:
enhance strengths
improve weaknesses
act on opportunities
mitigate threats

Step-By-Step SWOT Analysis
Strengths ‚Äî ask your team:
What are we genuinely good at?
What's the evidence for that?
Why would we include this strength in the box?
What do our clients say?
Can we truly say we're really good at that?
Are we strong on any particular environmental or social issue?

Once you're confident that your team have listed areas where you are genuinely strong, you can move on to Weaknesses.

Weaknesses ‚Äî ask your team these challenging questions:
Where are we weak?
Why do we think we're weak there?
What are we doing/not doing that is weak?
What doesn't work?
What environmental or social issues are we weak on?

With an open and honest discussion, you'll discover things you didn't have a clue about!

Opportunities ‚Äî you need to handle these questions carefully:
What opportunities are there to differentiate the business from the competition?
What opportunities are offered by adopting new technology?
Are these genuine opportunities that we can take advantage of?
Are there any opportunities to improve our environmental or social impact that will attract customers or reduce costs?
Can we quantify the opportunity?
Why has it been nominated as an opportunity?

Only once you have qualified an opportunity can it go into the Opportunities box inside the SWOT analysis tool.

Threats ‚Äî these questions can be quite alarming, but again, it's good practice to qualify the threats:
What threats are posed by the competition?
What threats are presented by changes in technology?
What threats are posed to the business by environmental or societal changes?
How big is the threat?
How imminent is it?

Once you have listed everything, the next step is to ask the team to look at the supplementary boxes I've added to the Enhanced SWOT analysis tool.

From SWOT to Strategy
The next step is to encourage the team to go beyond describing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Host a discussion on how to utilise the SWOT analysis to drive strategy.

Guide the team to focus on enhancing strengths, improving weaknesses, pursuing opportunities and mitigating threats. The aim is to align their insights with action plans that directly support the organisation's objectives.

Enhance strengths:
How are we going to enhance and reinforce your strengths?
How do we make sure we maintain them as our strengths?
How do we measure them?
How will we manage them going forward?

Improve areas of weakness:
How are we going to improve so we can reduce them?
What are we going to do to fix those weaknesses?
How can we measure our progress?

Action opportunities:
What actions are we going to take to explore them?
How are we going to validate if they're genuinely viable opportunities?
What do we need to put in place to take advantage of them?
Who is going to do that work?

Mitigate threats:
How can we learn more about them?
What can we do to reduce them?
Who is going to assess them fully?

You'll see that by completing all eight boxes, you'll have the beginnings of a real plan. You will know what you're good at and what you're not so good at. You will have identified genuine opportunities and registered the threats that you face.

You will know how to take advantage of all those opportunities and how to meet those threats. You will see clearly what you've got to measure in order to maintain your strengths and what you must do to fix your weaknesses. You should also know who is going to do each of these things.

The next step is to put this into an effective action plan.

The following two case studies illustrate the benefits of conducting an Enhanced SWOT analysis with the whole team. In discussion between different colleagues, we realised we had a huge opportunity at Tree Shepherd to broaden our market and secure more mainstream contracts. Similarly, at Green-Works, we devised a radical solution to one of our greatest competitive threats by bringing together the sales and operational teams.

üîéCase Study
When I conducted a SWOT analysis at Tree Shepherd, the team realised there was an opportunity to deliver our business skills, monitoring and training to established businesses.

The skills we taught to early-stage startup businesses were very similar to those needed by existing micro and small businesses. Our insight was that many micro and small business owners had not had any business training but had worked it out as they went along.

We were able to create a new service where we mentored and supported individuals with existing businesses using the same advisors, teachers and materials that we were using for the startup business course.

This enabled us to approach a vast new market and attract funding from local authorities and others keen to support their local small business networks.

üîéCase Study
At Green-Works, we were committed to reducing the amount of furniture that went to landfill and increasing the amount that was reused. However, it was less easy to distinguish our passion for reuse from competitors in the second-hand furniture market, who could also claim to be reusing furniture.

We wanted to create a clear differentiation between us and those traders. These competitors posed a genuine threat to our business. In our joint discussion, we came up with the idea of making our own furniture from the unwanted desktops and wardrobes. Within a short time, we purchased a CNC router to make new furniture from old desktops and wardrobes. This had multiple benefits.

Firstly, it added value to what was otherwise an expensive waste stream. Secondly, it enabled us to reach new customers who wanted more consistent furniture than we could provide from second-hand stocks. Finally, it was another differentiator from our competition, which helped keep us ahead and make our customers happy.

Exercise 11: Prepare Your Enhanced SWOT Analysis
Organise a team meeting to create your own Enhanced SWOT analysis. Try to create a safe space where ideas can flow and there can be a robust debate. It's important that all opinions are aired. It's also critical that opinions can be constructively challenged and tested so that what goes into your Enhanced SWOT analysis and the consequent action boxes is both precise and accurate.

    title: "CHAPTER 8: NETWORKING",
    theme: "Connections",
    content: `Knowing where you want to go is not the same as knowing how to get there. That can change and change a lot.
It's important to stay up to speed with that change. Everyone tells you to innovate: it's a constant drumbeat, but where do you find innovation?
I find it mainly through meeting people and listening to other ideas. In other words, I create innovation by getting out of the office and networking.

Connecting Ideas
Meeting new people from different backgrounds and experiences and listening to their take on the world can inspire creative thoughts. This is because our minds automatically interpret what other people say through our own experiences and apply it to our world.

That's the birthplace of innovation, where the experience of one world meets the perception of another, and a new thought develops. This is illustrated by the following case study.

üîéCase Study
While running a small environmental consultancy, 3RE, I attended a networking event where a speaker from the energy sector explained how they offered a save-and-share scheme to their customers. They helped them reduce energy through various efficiency measures and then took a share of the savings that they had created.

I instantly thought I could apply that save-and-share model to my waste management and recycling consultancy!

Testing Ideas and Plans
Networking can be a great opportunity for testing ideas. Before you put a lot of effort into developing an idea, you can easily gauge the likely response by talking to people about it at networking events.

The responses you get can focus your attention on the areas of most concern or interest and help you assess how well-received the idea might be.

Unlike feedback from an email or survey, the great thing about networking in person is that you can immediately see the reaction to what you're saying, as the following demonstrates.

üîéCase Study
At Papercycle, my first business, the strategy seemed to be embodied in the company name! Na√Øvely, I thought this locked me into just collecting paper and cardboard. However, as I talked to potential customers at various events, I heard there was a demand for other products to be recycled, and there were businesses out there offering these services.

I realised I could offer a combined recycling service to meet customer demand and beat the competition. We could add valuable new products to our collection process and make each collection more viable. Over the next few months, we started collecting plastic cups, aluminium cans and toner cartridges.

Competition Radar
When you tell people what your business does, they often tell you that they have come across another company that does something similar.

With a little prompting, you can find out a considerable amount about what the competition is offering and, most importantly, what that person found attractive about their offer. This allows you to incorporate new ideas into your offer.

Serendipity
I'm also passionate about networking because of the unanticipated and unexpected consequences that can flow just by meeting people. The following case study is a great example.

üîéCase Study
Early in 1998, I attended a social event with like-minded people involved in environmental issues. I had a few drinks and met a lot of people, including someone from the Environment Council.

If I'm honest, I drank rather too much. I came home a bit unsteady on my feet and woke up with a hangover. I regretted not making the best use of the networking opportunity.

All that doubt was washed away at about 9:30 AM when I groggily took a call from a procurement manager from Gateshead Council. He asked if I would like to tender for a consulting project to look at setting up a new factory for recycling and reusing white goods (cookers, washing machines, fridges, etc.), where young, unemployed people would be trained in the engineering and plumbing skills to fix them.

I was astonished! How on earth had this procurement manager in Gateshead Council (280 miles away) heard of my small environmental consultancy in London? He explained that he had just spoken to the Environment Council, and they had recommended me as someone who knew quite a lot about recycling and people who were long-term unemployed.

This amazing piece of serendipity led me to take a material role in helping to set up the Renew Northeast project. We set up a large factory where we trained scores of young people across the Northeast to fault-find and repair vast numbers of second-hand white goods.

I was involved in that project for over five years, from inception to delivery. It was immensely satisfying to create the business case for the project, including the economic viability, training potential and environmental benefits and then use the case to raise ¬£1.5 million from various government and charity funds to make it happen.

All of this came from one serendipitous (and drunken) networking conversation!

Getting Feedback (Ouch!)
Another good but far less comfortable reason for networking is to get direct feedback on your company. The following story is a good example of how you can learn a lot about how well your business is doing in the real world.

üîéCase Study
I remember attending a networking event with lots of suits drinking coffee and eating pastries. I'd introduced myself to a small group as running Green-Works.

In mid-conversation, I was taken to one side by one of the group. He explained that he had bought some furniture from Green-Works but wasn't happy with the service. The furniture had been delivered covered in pigeon poo. He and his wife had had to clean it all off before they could take it into the office.

He hadn't said anything or complained. He had just made a mental note not to use our service again and was potentially a person who would talk negatively about us in the future. However, in this networking event, he felt duty-bound to tell me the whole story and explain how it felt.

I wasn't happy to hear this, but this honest feedback was absolute gold dust because it identified a problem I was unaware of. I was able to go back to the warehouse manager and talk to him in no uncertain terms about how we needed to improve and set up a system for thoroughly checking all the furniture that went out to make sure it was spotless and fit for purpose immediately on delivery.

Exercise 12: List Your Networking Opportunities
What opportunities do you have for networking? Take some time to think this through as it's easy to forget some golden opportunities.

6 Tips for Networking
Most people I've spoken to hate networking. It makes them nervous. They don't know how to push themselves into a knot of people and start talking. Everyone, it seems, finds it quite stressful.

What can you do to make it less stressful?

1. üí°Tip: Remember the Key Purpose
The purpose of networking is not, as many believe, to get business, and it is not to secure as many business cards or contact details of people as possible.
Networking is an opportunity to create meaningful relationships with real people. The idea of networking is to meet people, get to know them and build your network.

The simple fact is people buy from people they like or who are recommended by others. Networking is a very effective way of building trust with others and being referred by them. As my example of meeting the Environment Council shows, it's not necessarily the individuals you meet but the people in their network that matters.

By meeting people meaningfully, you build up a reputation that goes before you. If you flit across the floor gathering business cards and pay little attention to people, you will not build the trust required for others to recommend you.

If you spend more time with fewer people and get to know them, you will gain a reputation as a sincere and trustworthy person with whom other people can do business. That is the point of networking.

I've discovered that by developing my network this way, I started to get more introductions to potential customers.

2. üí°Tip: Preparation
It's important to prepare well for a networking event. Firstly, make sure you're comfortable with what you're wearing, and ensure you're feeling good.

Get a good night's sleep if it's a breakfast event. Secondly, do some background reading on the event itself, who's hosting it and any immediate issues that are likely to come up in conversation.

Finally, have your business card (or QR code for people to scan) ready.

3. üí°Tip: Get There Early
A big benefit of arriving early is that it allows you to eat something before anybody comes in. More importantly, it gives you the chance to own the room, feel comfortable and be able to greet other people as they come in.

It puts you on the front foot and makes it much easier to start a conversation as people come to you.

4. üí°Tip: The Power of Small Talk
One of the icebreakers I use in my business workshops is asking attendees to talk about how they got to the venue that day. It's a straightforward exercise. Very quickly, the room is animated by conversation and laughter. It's often quite difficult to get people to stop talking.

Finally, when the room quietens down and I ask them what they are talking about, they have all moved on so far from which bus they used to get to the venue.

That is the power of small talk; to get the conversation started. The conversation is the critical part because what you're doing in a networking event is establishing rapport.

Dismiss any ideas that you're going to a networking event to get new business. You will not walk out of a networking event with a contract, but you will walk out with two or three much stronger relationships than you had before you walked in.

5. üí°Tip: Ask for an Introduction
This works well when you've got a list of attendees that you can scan beforehand or early on in the event. It saves a lot of circulating and staring at people's name badges, enabling you to focus on the people you really want to talk to.

I've used this technique to great effect on several occasions. Not only does the host take you straight to the person you want to meet, but you're also harnessing the host's social status to help you break into the conversation your subject is currently having.

You know how daunting it is to break into a cluster of suits in intense conversation! This technique helps you short-circuit that challenge and get to the people you truly want to see.

6. üí°Tip: Reach Out Digitally
There are very effective ways of networking digitally. I have used LinkedIn to connect with people who could potentially help me. This is one example of how it worked for me.

üîéCase Study
I had an idea to set up a new fund-raising scheme for charities, and I searched on LinkedIn for people who may have some insights into the idea that I was pulling together.

I identified two people I had never heard of, and I popped them a message on LinkedIn and asked if they would give me 15 minutes to talk through a project I was working on.

Both came back very quickly and offered me a short get-together via video conference on a Friday afternoon to discuss my ideas. Both were remarkably open and supportive.

The freshness of the response struck me. I realised they were both willing to give me some of their time, partly, I think, because they were flattered to be approached and partly because, with online meetings, they can control how much time they spend on meeting you.

If you want some help and advice, I recommend reaching out on social media. People are pleased to help and advise as they're flattered that their expertise has been recognised.

Exercise 13: Assess Your Networking
How good are you at networking? Take the seven-point networking test to assess your approach.

Scoring A = 5 points B = 3 points C = 1 point
28‚Äì35 points? You are a networking ninja!
19‚Äì27 points? Room for improvement.
<18 points? Have a rethink.`,
    summary: "Effective networking is about building genuine relationships rather than collecting business cards, and can lead to unexpected opportunities, valuable feedback, and innovative ideas.",
    quote: "The most valuable business connections often come not from those you directly meet, but from the people they know."
